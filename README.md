# Divertio

Divertio is an Android application which uses the YoutubeInMP3 API to convert youtube videos into mp3 files on your Android device. It is also functions as a standard MP3 player, and is able to search for MP3 files to use on your device. 

## Installation and Usage

**Requirements:**

 - An Android device (pref running 4.0+)
 - Android Studio to upload the app onto your phone

In order to download Youtube videos and convert them to MP3 files, you will need an internet connection. However, most of the app, including standard MP3 player functions, will work without an internet connection. 

**Usage:**

Click the overflow button on the home page to open up a window that will direct you in converting Youtube videos. You can also click the add button to automatically search for pre-existing songs on your phone. The MP3 player functions are self-explanatory.
